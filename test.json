    "post_text": "Okay so my father got remarried about 2 years ago. I turn 23 on this coming up Sunday and hes been single all the way up until but thats not really something I mind. Anyway. So him and his wife just had a baby. My baby brother LT. We'll. LT finally gets to come home from the hospital today after 6 weeks because hes been having to be weened off of drugs because my dad and Bonnie are on drugs. She knew she was pregnant and never stopped. My dads been on drugs or been an alchoholic or both my whole life so whatever I guess. The thing is. My grandma has gotten custody of Bonnies two youngest kids and LT comes home today and me and my girlfriend have to help my grandma take care of everyone. Help with homework all that jazz. I dont want any of this though. I'm so mad at dad and i feel trapped in this situation. I hope dad can get cleaned up so he can have LT back but like.... He never cleaned up for me and I want LT to have a better life than me but like.... Id be mad.... Because I feel like he doesnt love me and my birthday is Sunday and its gonna be all about LT which isnt his fault but its never been about me my whole life and now this.... I feel like suicide is my only escape but I can't do that to my grandma and all my siblings and step siblings that love me. God I just wish none of this was real. Help me feel better. Please. Im so sorry this is so long. I just dont know what to do."

    "post_text": "I'm alway feeling like this. It doesn't even matter the age we are anymore. When we are feeling low it's just that. I've been dealing with depression/anxiety since I was 12/13. It comes with just a long story that I was never able to overcome it. I tried to seek help and when she tried to suggest medication since I was already angry I just never went back. \nI just got to a point where I just say I'm ok when asked HOW ARE YOU? It's just easier to say I'm ok,  than explaining how I feel. \n\nnight time is the worst for me since I'm alone in my room. I've tried to text people that I was once able to do, but that turned out wrong for me so I guess I don't have that option anymore. \n\nI've done things in the past where I am trying to avoid but as selfish as that may sound to others I found my comfort in that.  I don't want to do that anymore.  Finally admitted to myself that I cannot do this anymore by myself. \nThis whole year has been a night mare for me but I still tried and I feel like kept falling deeper and deeper. Like being in a coma but with my eyes open. Like being in a crowded room and yet I'm still feeling alone, boxed in, no way out. I've become so afraid of being alone, that I am alone.\n Lost valuable friends, a great partner and I cannot get any of it back. \nI held back on telling people how I feel with the fear of losing anyone else. But that hold inside me makes it worse and I know that, but I don't want to lose anyone else. I don't know if I would, but that thought is just there. I feel as if I sleep walk awake. Sorry it just been to  much. My heart beats fast, with just even writing this my head hurts from it all. \nI want to tell people how I feel the ones matter, but its that fear that hold me back. Don't know why or where this all came from but it's been even harder to get myself together. Maybe I deserve to be alone. I deserve to not have you as my friend. I just feel lost and empty.\n "

        "post_text": "So long story short, my grandma is an alcoholic, she's depressed, and she's revealed to me today that she wishes she was dead all the time.  She's tried for a long time these help herself, to get out of her addiction to alcohol and cigarettes, but she really can't do it herself.  She fell today (and has multiple times before) after drinking heavily, and it took a while to get her back up due to her obesity. This was when she told me she wishes she was dead. I told her that she doesn't wish that and she's not thinking clearly because she's drunk, and she told me she feels the same way when she's sober. I know that to have suicidal thoughts, you aren't thinking clearly by definition. I didn't explain that to her though.  A lot of my family struggles with addiction and depression, and I'd say my grandma is in a better state than most of them.\n\n I'm curious what steps anyone here has taken in getting a family member the help they need. What resources are available to me and how do I help someone who is fortunate enough to at least want to help themselves?  Thank you in advance."
